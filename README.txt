REQUIRES Pillow (pip install Pillow)

Requires a square image to avoid stretching. 500x500 works fine, other sizes will also work. Image is automatically resized to output a 1080x1080 Twitter thumbnail and a 250x250 FA thumbnail.

Usage: thumbnailer4.py <image> <title> <tags (optional)>

Example thumbnails were generated by running the command:

python thumbnailer4.py me.jpg "Example Title" "Example Tag" "Example Tag"
